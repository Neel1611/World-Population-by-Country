### Insights
* Russia being the largest country by area (17.1 million square kilometers) is consistent with its vast landmass.
* Vatican City being the smallest country by area (0.44 square kilometers) aligns with its extremely small size.
* Syria and Moldova having the highest growth rate in the world (0.0498) indicates significant population growth in these countries.
* Ukraine having the worst growth rate in the world (-0.0745) suggests a decline in population.
* India being the most populated country in the world and China being close in terms of population (17.8%) reflects the significant population of both countries.
* Macau having the most densely populated country (21,402.7 people per square kilometer) and Greenland having the least densely populated country (0.14 people per square kilometer) highlight population density differences.
* The convergence of India's and China's population by 2022 and India becoming the highest populated country by 2023 indicates a potential shift in global population dynamics.
* Out of the top 5 economies, China and Japan experiencing population decline, while India and the US seeing population growth, with the US having more stable growth and India showing a potentially robust growth pattern. Germany is projected to have a stable population.
